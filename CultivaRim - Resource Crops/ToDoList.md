// TODO: Automate creation of colour matched "stuff crops"
- Generate defs based on resources using colour coded crops, pulling the colour from the stuff props of the resource.
- Generate essence items based on those same resources, using the same colour coded method.
- Generate recipes for turning essence into resources at a new bench.
- Balance plant stats based on some of the stuff props variables, with an optional mod extension for fine tuning in patches.

// TODO: Create crops for resources which cannot be automated easily.
